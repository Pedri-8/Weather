🌦️ Weather Dashboard

This is a simple and responsive weather dashboard built with **React.js**. It lets users search for any city and displays the current weather using data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**. I focused on building a clean UI, integrating the API smoothly, and handling both loading and error states properly.
